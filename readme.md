# Hi, welcome to the font teller project!

We, Venkatesh and Zhijian, are PhD students at Georgia Tech. **Font teller** is our project for course CX 4240 - Introduction to Computational Data Analysis (a.k.a Introduction to Machine Learning). In this project, we used synthetic images of letters in different fonts and trained multiple machine learning models including **random forest**, **logistic regression**, and c**onvolutional neural network (CNN)**, with the assistance of **principal component analysis (PCA)** as a pre-processing of data. Check in with the link down below on how we were able to distinguish letters in 13 different fonts.
