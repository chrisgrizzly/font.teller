          <span class="attention">logistic regression</span>,

        <p>(0. Machine learning is fun.)</p>
        <p>1. Both random forest and CNN have shown promising results in font recognition, with high accuracies 83% and 100%, respectively.</p>
        <p>2. Parameter optimization and PCA can enhance the performance of random forest very much.</p>
        <p>3. (Bonus) Confusion matrix can actually tell which fonts are more similar.</p>

          We hope this project,
          <span class="attention">achieved with simple models and low computation resources</span>,
          can inspire people (including us) to further develop font detection to benifit industries and global communities.

        <p>Some extensions for future considerations:</p>
        <p>1. Test with real-life data, even live data from video cameras.</p>
        <p>2. Build plug-ins for applications such as PDF readers.</p>
        <p>3. Adding detections of other aspects of fonts, such as color, size, highlight, bold, italic, and underscore.</p>
